## UtilisingExcelAndTableau
As part of the *JustIT Data Bootcamp* I completed an assessment report showcasing my newly learnt skills on **Microsft Excel** and **Tableau**.
In the document included you can view my entire assessment report, this includes:
<br>
* A cover page
* A contents page
* An Excel task
* A Tableau task with visualisations
* A reflection of my progress
<br>
This assessment was completed early in my bootcamp course; displaying my skills as a learner.
